## Abstract

ForestGuard is a decentralized, solar-powered environmental monitoring system designed to provide large-scale, tamper-resistant forest protection. It combines ultra-low-cost MicroSensor nodes deployed across forest landscapes, a self-organizing mesh network to relay data to edge gateways, and a blockchain-based Proof-of-Environment (PoE) ledger that mints Environment Coins (ECO) for verified positive ecological outcomes. To ensure system integrity, ForestGuard employs hardware-rooted attestation, closed-signed firmware, supply-chain controls, spatial constraints (nodes ≥ 1 km apart), randomized external audits, and economic staking/slashing mechanisms to make cheating prohibitively expensive.

## 1. Introduction

Forest fires, habitat loss, and biodiversity decline present global threats requiring novel detection, measurement, and incentive mechanisms. Traditional monitoring systems either lack the density to detect early ignitions or are prohibitively expensive to scale. ForestGuard offers a low-cost, resilient alternative: a dense network of low-cost MicroSensors that convert local environmental signals into a globally verifiable ledger that rewards preservation and penalizes fraud.

This whitepaper documents ForestGuard's architecture, security model, Proof-of-Environment consensus, deployment strategy for 1 km spacing, anti-cheating design, and governance rules for ECO token distribution.

## 2. System Overview

### 2.1 Components

- **MicroSensor Nodes** — Ultra-low-cost, solar-assisted sensors measuring temperature, particulate matter (PM), acoustic activity, light, and motion. Nodes are required to be at least **1 km** apart to ensure spatial distribution and to raise the cost of simulation-based cheating.

- **Mesh Network** — A long-range, low-power mesh (custom LoRa P2P or sub-GHz mesh stack) with store-and-forward routing, priority forwarding for urgent alerts (e.g., fire), and aggregation for routine telemetry.

- **Edge Gateways** — Solar-powered or hybrid gateway devices located at forest borders or elevated points; they collect, verify, and upload aggregated data to the blockchain layer using cellular, satellite, or terrestrial backhaul.

- **Blockchain & Smart Contracts** — A lightweight PoE blockchain that stores attested environmental data, verifies cross-node consistency and external audits, and mints ECO tokens according to published rules.

- **Audit & Validation** — Satellite, drone, and third-party audits form the external validation backbone to cross-check on-chain claims.

## 3. Node Design & Operation

### 3.1 Hardware & Sensors

- Secure Element (e.g., ATECC608A or equivalent) with factory-provisioned unique key
- Temperature and humidity sensing
- PM2.5/PM10 optical particulate sensor (or low-power alternative)
- MEMS microphone with on-device feature extraction (privacy-preserving hashed features)
- Light sensor and PIR motion detector
- Low-power MCU with secure boot and firmware signature verification
- Small solar panel and battery sized for multi-day autonomy

### 3.2 Duty Cycle & Modes

- **Normal Mode:** long sleep intervals with periodic beaconing and low-frequency telemetry to conserve power.
- **Event Mode:** triggered by threshold breaches (rapid ΔT, PM spike, IR/optical flame signature, acoustic anomaly). In event mode the node shortens sleep intervals, captures short audio/image thumbnails, and forwards urgent packets with high priority.
- **Store-and-Forward:** nodes buffer data in flash and forward hop-by-hop toward an edge gateway.

### 3.3 1 km Spacing Implications

- Each node covers approximately 0.9–1.0 km² (hex vs square grid considerations).
- Reduced spatial redundancy requires stronger emphasis on sensor quality, external validation, and elevated mounting to increase sensing and RF line-of-sight.

## 4. Mesh Networking & Routing

### 4.1 Gradient Routing

Gateways broadcast HELLO(distance=0) beacons to form a hop-count gradient. Nodes forward toward neighbors with decreasing distance metric; tie-breakers include RSSI and battery level. Neighbor tables are small, and forwarding uses multi-path redundancy for urgent messages.

### 4.2 Duty Scheduling

Nodes sleep 95–99% of the time under normal operation. Wake windows synchronize for short exchanges. Urgent mode reduces sleep intervals to seconds for fast per-hop forwarding.

### 4.3 Latency Targets

Design targets: end-to-edge alert latency ≤ 10 minutes under urgent mode, with recommended maximum hops ≤ 6–8 in urgent mode to meet this target.

## 5. Proof-of-Environment (PoE) Consensus

### 5.1 Core Principles

PoE replaces PoW's energy burn with verifiable, cross-validated environmental consistency. Blocks containing environmental data are accepted only after meeting a combination of:

- Local cross-node corroboration
- Temporal persistence and escalation checks
- External validation (satellite/drone) for sparse regions
- Valid cryptographic attestation from participating devices

### 5.2 ECO Minting Rules (Summary)

- Minting requires a minimum set of corroborating attestations from nodes in a region and no recent evidence of tampering.
- Sparse regions (1 km spacing) require longer confirmation windows and increased weight for external validators.
- Randomized audits and stake-slashing discourage dishonesty.

## 6. Security & Anti-Cheating Framework

(Full section containing the following subsections: Hardware Root-of-Trust, Firmware Security, Remote Attestation Protocol, Environmental Entropy Proof, Economic & Spatial Deterrence, Supply-Chain Security Checklist, Attestation Message Format, Governance & Transparency.)

**Note:** This section includes a compact, LoRa-friendly attestation message format, a supply-chain checklist, device registry requirements, and protocol pseudocode for both device and gateway verification flows.

---

## 7. Supply-Chain & Manufacturing

A secure manufacturing process is required to prevent large-scale compromise. Key controls include:

- Verified secure element vendors and audited injection facilities
- Immutable logging of key injection (on-chain hash of injection events)
- Sampled QA and tamper-evidence testing
- Serialized device registry uploaded to blockchain prior to activation

---

## 8. Audit, Governance & Economics

- **Stake-Based Participation:** organizations and governments stake ECO tokens as collateral.
- **Audits & Slashing:** detected fraud results in slashing; proven positive stewardship yields periodic ECO rewards.
- **Public Registry & Transparency Portal:** device certificates, firmware hashes, revocation lists, and audit logs are public.

---

## 9. Privacy & Ethics

- Audio and environmental features are hashed on-device; raw audio/images are not stored unless explicitly authorized for audit or research.
- Deployment requires local permission and compliance with privacy laws.
- Devices are non-invasive and designed to minimize wildlife disturbance.

---

## 10. Deployment Strategy & Example: 100 km² Reserve

- Node count (1 km spacing): ~100 nodes. Place gateways at strategic edge points to ensure ≤ 8 hops.
- Hybrid densification: increase node density near high-risk points (villages, ridgelines) for redundancy.
- Drone-based periodic audits: monthly or randomized quarterly passes for PoE validation.

---

## 11. Conclusion

ForestGuard builds a new paradigm for environmental stewardship: a tamper-resistant, incentive-driven ecology that financially rewards conservation and empowers independent verification. By making cheating more costly than honest participation, ForestGuard aligns economic incentives with planetary survival.
